### Some questions to ask?

We encourage you to ask your questions in the [Q&A category](https://github.com/Seddryck/DubUrl/discussions/categories/q-a) of the discussions feature on the the GitHub repository. Please don't use Twitter or LinkedIn for this.

### Ideas for new features?

New ideas are welcome! Feel free to share them in the [Ideas category](https://github.com/Seddryck/DubUrl/discussions/categories/ideas) of the discussions feature on the the GitHub repository.

You already have a good idea how to describe your new idea? Go ahead and write down your user-story in the [Issues](https://github.com/Seddryck/DubUrl/issues) tab. No specific format is needed.

### Facing a bug?

Please report the discovered bug in the [Issues](https://github.com/Seddryck/DubUrl/issues) section. No specific format of report is needed but we need to know the connection url that you're using (feel free to change a few chars but we need something very close) and also the version of the provider (and of the database). If you're receiving an error message, please include it!

### Willing to contribute?

The best is always to first open an [idea](https://github.com/Seddryck/DubUrl/discussions/categories/ideas) or an [issue](https://github.com/Seddryck/DubUrl/issues). Always better to discuss the purpose before going too far on the development. 

Then, when implemented, you can  submit [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Seddryck/DubUrl/pulls). Don't forget to include the corresponding tests and documentation, we won't accept any pull request that is not coming with tests and/or documentation. Your pull requests will be manually reviewed and accepted.

### Other kind of contact needed?

The best is to shout me (in English or French) on [@Seddryck](https://twitter.com/Seddryck) on twitter. Naturally, answering questions or providing support is not possible through this medium, use the means provided above for this kind of questions.
